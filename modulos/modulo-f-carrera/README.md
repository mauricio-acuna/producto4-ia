"Thank you for the offer! I'm excited about the opportunity and the team. 
I've done some research on market rates for this role, and based on my 
experience with [specific AI technologies] and track record of [specific 
achievements], I was expecting something closer to $[X]. Can we discuss

```

### Multi-Offer Strategy

#### Playing Offers Against Each Other
```python
# Offer Comparison Framework
offer_analysis = {
    "company_a": {
        "base_salary": 250000,
        "equity_value": 100000,  # 4-year expected value
        "bonus_target": 50000,
        "total_comp": 400000,
        "intangibles": {
            "growth_potential": 8,  # 1-10 scale
            "culture_fit": 9,
            "learning_opportunities": 7,
            "work_life_balance": 6
        }
    },
    "company_b": {
        "base_salary": 220000,
        "equity_value": 150000,

            "growth_potential": 9,
            "culture_fit": 7,
            "learning_opportunities": 9,
            "work_life_balance": 8
        }

# Decision Framework: Weighted scoring
weights = {
    "total_comp": 0.4,
    "growth_potential": 0.25,
    "culture_fit": 0.2,
    "learning_opportunities": 0.1,
    "work_life_balance": 0.05
}
```

#### Negotiation Sequencing
```yaml
Week 1: Receive initial offers, don't commit
Week 2: Research and prepare counter-arguments
Week 3: Counter-offer with best alternative, negotiate
Week 4: Finalize terms and make decision

Best Practices:
  - Never lie about competing offers
