        "total_comp": 400000,
        "intangibles": {
            "growth_potential": 8,  # 1-10 scale
            "culture_fit": 9,
            "learning_opportunities": 7,
            "work_life_balance": 6
        }
    },
    "company_b": {

    "culture_fit": 0.2,
    "learning_opportunities": 0.1,
    "work_life_balance": 0.05
}
```

#### Negotiation Sequencing
